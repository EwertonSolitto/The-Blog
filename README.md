# About 📝

https://ewertonsolitto.github.io/The-Blog/

**The Blog** is a Front End application built on a challenge made by [Rocketseat](https://app.rocketseat.com.br). 

It's a blog for developers, with publications to the most advanced. All the posts were made with AI, because the idea of the website is to show my skills as a developer.
